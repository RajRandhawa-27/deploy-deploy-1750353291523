# Premium Creative Portfolio - Dynamic Website

A sophisticated, data-driven portfolio website built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Framer Motion. This project implements a dynamic architecture that separates content from presentation, making it easy to customize and maintain.

## ðŸŒŸ Dynamic Features

This website follows a **Dynamic Website Architecture** where:

- All content is externalized into data files
- Components conditionally render based on data availability
- Easy content management without touching component code
- Flexible section ordering and configuration
- Built-in validation and error handling


### Disabling Sections

To disable any section, set `isRequired: false` in its data file:


### Customizing Animations

Each section supports custom animation timings:

```typescript
animations: {
  textDelay: 0.3,        // Delay between text reveals
  descriptionDelay: 2,   // When description appears
  buttonDelay: 2.5       // When button appears
}
```

## ðŸŽ¨ Styling

The website uses:

- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling
- **Custom CSS variables** for theme colors
- **Framer Motion** for animations
- **Responsive design** for all screen sizes

### Color Scheme

- Primary: Zinc/Gray scale
- Accent: Amber/Orange gradients
- Background: Dark theme with subtle variations

## ðŸ”§ Development

### Adding New Sections

1. Create a data file in `data/` directory
2. Create corresponding component in `components/`
3. Add conditional rendering in `app/page.tsx`

- Missing required fields won't render the component
- Optional fields are handled gracefully
- Type checking ensures data consistency
